<p>
  My name is Mai Huy Hoang (梅辉煌 or Mei Brilliant - via Google Translate) from Vietnam. The profile picture above isn't me (of course), it's just a random drawing in class and you can imagine my face whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
  I learned coding in Tran Phu High School for Gifted Students, glad to see you if you're studying or graduated from there too.
</p>

<p>
  I dropped out of university because for me it was a disaster. Just kidding, I'm studying Chinese Language in Tianjin Univeristy as a requirement before going into Peking University. I choose Computer Science as my desired major and I have four years experience
  coding. Despite of that, I know I'm still a noob.

<p>
  My (very next) dream is studying Master somewhere in Europe or US (I prefer Netherlands because of EDM festivals) and I'm hopefully to get an internship in a software company like Google (just another challenge).
</p>
<p>
  About hobbies, I love reading books (for entertainment, not for knowledge, pls don't think of me as a nerd), listening to music (US-UK and EDM all the time) and playing DotA (I really should quit, this game ruins my future).
